## Description

One destination attachment: active flag, optional native transform and layer/sublayer stacking; no viewport ownership.

## Verification

[RenderingCanvasTests](../../tests/Electron2D.Tests/RenderingCanvasTests.cs) exercises actual projections, native replay and cleanup. Scope and limits are recorded in [the canvas contract](../components/canvas-rendering.md#caller-owned-canvases-and-items).
