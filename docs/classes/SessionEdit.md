# SessionEdit

Last updated: 2026-10-26

- **Assembly/namespace:** `Electron2D.Editor.Session` / `Electron2D.Editor`.
- **Source:** [ProjectSession.Models.cs](../../editor/Session/ProjectSession.Models.cs).
- **Declaration:** `public abstract record SessionEdit;`

A typed request in an atomic authoring group.

This abstract base has no own public methods/properties. The concrete requests are SessionTransformEdit, SessionRenameEdit, SessionReparentEdit and SessionCodeEdit; unknown subtypes reject at Apply.

## Usage, validation and lifetime

See the [compiled operation consumer](../../tests/ProjectSession/Program.cs), [session example](ProjectSession.md#example) and [SessionClient](SessionClient.md) methods for creation/inspection/submission. IDs and expected tokens come from the current shared snapshots; undo/redo publishes fresh tokens. Arbitrary record copies do not mutate the owner. Conflicts expose SessionConflictException; invalid requests and unsupported roles fail before publication. The [component](../components/project-session.md) defines bounds, threading, persistence and actual verification limits. This is tooling API outside the runtime census.
