## Description

Cold stable canvas RID registration, owned lifetime and weak borrowed scene sweeping.

## Verification

[RenderingCanvasTests](../../tests/Electron2D.Tests/RenderingCanvasTests.cs) exercises actual projections, native replay and cleanup. Scope and limits are recorded in [the canvas contract](../components/canvas-rendering.md#caller-owned-canvases-and-items).

## Viewport world integration

[Canvas and physics worlds](../components/worlds.md) documents World.Canvas, Viewport.World/FindWorld, nearest-viewport CanvasItem access, shared rendering, independent physics, membership changes and runtime lifetime. Existing server and native kernels remain the implementation path. [WorldTests](../../tests/Electron2D.Tests/WorldTests.cs) supplies direct behavior and actual target-pixel evidence.
